<div dir="ltr">This is a remake of the <b>P-99: Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems</b> collection that I assembled over several years of teaching at the University of Applied Sciences (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ti.bfh.ch%2Fen.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFrqEzd-P8F4k-Ocow3fjf7NVjVCHhjTZw" target="_blank">Berner Fachhochschule</a>) at Biel-Bienne, Switzerland. The collection is structured into seven sections. I have renumbered the problems in order to get more freedom to rearrange things within the sections.<br>
<br>
The purpose of this problem collection is to give you the opportunity
to practice your skills in logic programming. Your goal should be
to find the most elegant solution of the given problems. Efficiency is
important, but logical clarity is even more crucial. Some of the (easy) 
problems can be trivially solved using built-in predicates.
However, in these cases, you learn more if you try to find your 
own solution.<br>
<br>
Every predicate that you write should begin with a comment
that describes the predicate in a <i>declarative</i> statement.
Do <i>not</i> describe procedurally, <i>what</i> the predicate does, 
but write down a <i>logical statement</i> which includes the 
arguments of the predicate. You should also indicate the intended data types of the arguments and the allowed flow patterns.<br><br>The problems have different levels of difficulty. 
Those marked with a single asterisk (*) are easy. If you have 
successfully solved the preceeding problems 
you should be able to solve them within a few (say 15) minutes.
Problems marked with two asterisks (**) are of intermediate 
difficulty. If you are a skilled Prolog programmer it
shouldn't take you more than 30-90 minutes to solve them.
Problems marked with three asterisks (***) are more difficult.
You may need more time (i.e. a few hours or more) to find a good solution.<br><div style="margin:5px 10px 0pt 0pt;display:inline;float:left"><img border="0" src="https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/_/rsrc/1264864357592/home/prolog-program.gif"></div><br>You can find <b>solutions</b> of the problems at the end of each section.
