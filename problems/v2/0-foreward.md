# Prolog Problems

This is a remake of the **P-99: Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems** collection
that I assembled over several years of teaching at the University of
Applied Sciences [Berner Fachhochschule](https://www.bfh.ch/ti/en/)
at Biel-Bienne, Switzerland.
The collection is structured into seven sections. I have renumbered the
problems in order to get more freedom to rearrange things within the
sections.

The purpose of this problem collection is to give you the opportunity to
practice your skills in logic programming. Your goal should be to find
the most elegant solution of the given problems. Efficiency is
important, but logical clarity is even more crucial. Some of the (easy)
problems can be trivially solved using built-in predicates. However, in
these cases, you learn more if you try to find your own solution.

Every predicate that you write should begin with a comment that
describes the predicate in a *declarative* statement. Do *not* describe
procedurally, *what* the predicate does, but write down a *logical
statement* which includes the arguments of the predicate. You should
also indicate the intended data types of the arguments and the allowed
flow patterns.

The problems have different levels of difficulty. Those marked with a
single asterisk (\*) are easy. If you have successfully solved the
preceeding problems you should be able to solve them within a few (say
15) minutes. Problems marked with two asterisks (\*\*) are of
intermediate difficulty. If you are a skilled Prolog programmer it
shouldn't take you more than 30-90 minutes to solve them. Problems
marked with three asterisks (\*\*\*) are more difficult. You may need
more time (i.e. a few hours or more) to find a good solution.

You can find **solutions** of the problems at the end of each section.
All programs have been tested on the
[SWI-Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org/)
system. SWI-Prolog offers a comprehensive

education as well as for commercial applications.
